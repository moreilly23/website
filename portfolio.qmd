Welcome to my portfolio! Here is a look at some recent work. 

## Four storied

Here is a link to a major reporting assignment I did this past summer: https://fourstoried.com/
  
FourStoried was a joint media venture between GWU and WVU that focused on community reporting. I covered two discint communities, the West Side neighborhood in Charleston, WV, and the LGBTQ in Dupont Circle/ADMO. The central focus in this project was to prioritize the subjects and allow them to voice concerns regarding issues they felt their respective communities were facing.

## Visual

Below is a link to visual work that I have worked on, which includes video, audio, and visual graphics.
