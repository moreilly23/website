## Four storied

"Here is a a major reporting assignment I did this past summer!.

FourStoried was a joint media venture between GWU and WVU that focused on community reporting. I covered two discint communities, the West Side neighborhood in Charleston, WV, and the LGBTQ in Dupont Circle/ADMO. The central focus in this project was to prioritize the subjects and allow them to voice concerns regarding issues they felt their respective communities were facing
