Welcome to my portfolio! Here is a look at some recent work. 

## Fourstoried

Here is a link to a major reporting assignment I did this past summer: https://fourstoried.com/
  
"FourStoried was a joint media venture between GWU and WVU that focused on community reporting. I covered two discint communities, the West Side neighborhood in Charleston, WV, and the LGBTQ in Dupont Circle/ADMO"."The central focus in this project was to prioritize the subjects and allow them to voice concerns regarding issues they felt their respective communities were facing."
